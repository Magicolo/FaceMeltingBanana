Prefabs:
-TileBasic
	Simple tile; cube with collider...
	
-TileSnake (Snake puzzle)
	Tiles that detect the gameObject named "Player" and when it exits trigger, the tile falls
	Note: The tile is not destroyed when falling

-TileColor (Color tile path puzzle)
	Tiles that will light up correctly (green) if the gameObject named "Player" steps on the TileColor set in the 'NextTile' field on the StateMachine
	A path can be built by setting the 'IsNextTile' field to true on the first tile of the path and then chaining TileColor with each of theirs 'NextTile' field
	Note: The path creation should be automated
	
-WallBasic
	Simple wall; cube with collider again...
	
-WallFake (Invisible wall puzzle)
	Even simpler wall; cube WITHOUT collider...
	
-RiddleItem (Blue/Red pill puzzle)
	Pickable item by the gameObject named "Player" then destroyed; The 'IsCorrectChoice' field will determine if the player picked the right item
	Note: Should send a message to the 'PuzzleManager' (that doesn't exist yet) before being destroyed
	
	
General notes:
-All missing logic should be added to the states or state layers associated with the StateMachine component when it exists
-There should be basic tiles under walls
